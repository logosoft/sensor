## About

The project demonstrates how to handle multiple data sources containing a huge amount of data.
The same functionality was implemented using vanilla scala and
[Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html).
For both cases it is shown how to deal with data sources sequentially and in parallel.

There is also a demonstration of a purely functional approach using 
[Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/). 

[Scala Test](https://www.scalatest.org/) library was used for testing.
The tests are written in FlatSpec style.
